- using flask shell

First, make sure your Flask application is running using Docker Compose. You can start your services with:
Copy code
docker-compose up
Once your services are up and running, you can access the terminal of your Python container where Flask is running. You can do this using the docker-compose exec command. Open a new terminal window and run:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec python sh
This command will open a shell session within the Python container.

Now, within the container's shell session, you can run the Flask shell command:
Copy code
flask shell
This command will start an interactive Python shell with your Flask application context loaded, allowing you to interact with your application and database.

That's it! You are now inside the Flask shell within your Docker container, and you can execute Python commands within the context of your Flask application.
